## Method

Heat oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes. Add cayenne and cook until onion is translucent.

Add Spice Mix and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 - 2 minutes until the spice is fragrant and wet. If too dry, add a tiny touch of water or oil.

Add capsicum and zucchini, cook for 1 minute.

Add tomato, broth, potato and cauliflower. Mix well, bring to simmer, cover, lower heat to medium.

Simmer for 15 minutes or until potato is pretty soft, then remove lid and simmer for another 10 minutes+ until sauce is slightly thickened and potato is soft.

Add peas, stir, cook for 2 minutes. Add coriander and spinach, stir until wilted.

Season to taste until salt and pepper. Serve over basmati rice or plain white rice. Garnish with yoghurt and more coriander.
