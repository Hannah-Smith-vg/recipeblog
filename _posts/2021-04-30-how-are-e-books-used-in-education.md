eBooks have become a useful tool in education, they cheaper to buy less copies need to be bought and they can also allow for students to highlight and edit without damaging the actual text especially if it is owned by the school. On top of this with free E-reader apps available on phones schools do not even need to invest in expensive equipment full students to be able to use them. The oldest and most common way that eBooks are used within schools is a complex eBook created from textbooks. these eBooks not only include the textbook but allow for images and graphs to be zoomed in on as well As for videos to be linked to photos creating more teaching tools. these are expensive to produce and for schools to buy as such schools usually only use them for subjects that need more visual aid, physical education and technology are some of the subjects most suited to these types of the books and the ones most often used by schools as they allow for clear demonstration of techniques that teachers may not be able to do safely in the classroom.

 

Students themselves often buy eBooks as well as when buying study guides and workbooks they often have an eBook link which students can download allowing them to have an eBook copy of all of their workbooks. these can be popular among students especially GCSE students as it allows them to carry all of their study guides and workbooks which can easily number in the double figures to cover all their subjects. While students may not prefer books over textbooks the ability to carry multiple workbooks at the same time can make revision easier as topics that are covered in previous workbooks that students may need for lessons will be easily accessible without carrying all of their physical workbooks all the time.

A third way that eBooks can be used in education is full the visually impaired, eBooks can be converted into different formats allowing for Braille readers to be able to show the text for blind students. On top of this eBook text fonts can change size allowing for students with other disability's that may affect their reading capabilities such as dyslexia to be able to change the font size and background colour in order to suit them more meaning that they are less likely to fall behind the students due to their inability to read textbooks and workbooks.
