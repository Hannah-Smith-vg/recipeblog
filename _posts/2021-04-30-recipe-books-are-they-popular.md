What is one type of book that nearly everyone owns at least one of? recipe books. they are a staple of our kitchens and are often unique in colour content and design more so than any other nonfiction genre. There are recipe books targeted at everyone no matter what age you are, as such it is not hard to believe the idea that they are a staple in many households. However, the rise of the internet has changed things as now people can assess recipes for free, they no longer must buy recipe books to learn cooking. So, like in other aspects of the publishing industry publishers have had to take many steps to compete.

So how do recipe books stand out? Well, they become unique and easy to navigate. In stead of being a necessity they market themselves as an easier way to find what you need. As instead of spending hours looking through different websites to find the one recipe you need you can now find it easily as well as other like it. Older recipe books seem to be more general but now they always have a purpose or an author to attract the audience. Often to sell the purpose is essential for a recipe book all the recipes must be based around a theme, this still allows for the choice of genre to be a wide as possible as the books can cover anything from alcoholic drinks to weight loss, beginners to advance levels and any country the author chooses. Due to there purpose and the easy of access recipe books are still popular to buy. But that does not always mean that they are popular to use.

Whilst many people have recipe books, they are not always popular to use, many people prefer to use the recipes that they are already familiar with and can complete quickly rather than learning a new time-consuming recipe. Many people do not want to learn and struggle through a new recipe if they have been working all day, they would just prefer to use what is know to them so that they can eat quickly. Also, YouTube videos and blog can often be more helpful if you are able to find the right recipe as it can give you more images of what each stage it meant to look like as well as be more in-depth in the technique needed so whilst finding the right recipe in them may be harder it can also be more helpful. So whilst recipe books are still popular to buy they are not as popular to use as they used to be.
